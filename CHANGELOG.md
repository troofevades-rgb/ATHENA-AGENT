### Changed
- `ocode/memory.py` refactored into the `ocode/memory/` package; legacy workspace-keyed API preserved (Phase 5)
- Agent loop fires plugin lifecycle hooks (`on_session_start`, `on_user_message`, `pre_tool_call`, `post_tool_call`, `on_assistant_message`, `on_session_end`); the existing settings.json hook system in `ocode/hooks.py` is unchanged and runs alongside (Phase 5)
- Sub-agent dispatch tool now calls Agent.fork() under the hood
- ocode/agent.py split into ocode/agent/{core,fork}.py
- ocode/skills/ (slash-command handlers) renamed to ocode/commands/ to free
  the name for the new file-based skill format
- Agent.run_turn now persists every user / assistant / tool message to the
  session store (JSONL + SQLite FTS5)
- Hermes sessions_importer drives SessionStore so imports land in
  `ocode sessions list` and FTS5 search
